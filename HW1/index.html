                        The dog (<i>Canis familiaris</i> when 
                        considered a distinct species or <i>Canis lupus 
                        familiaris</i> when considered a subspecies of 
                        the wolf) is a domesticated carnivore of the 
                        family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids, 
                        and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. 
                        The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern 
                        wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first 
                        domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog 
                        is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, 
                        and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, 
                        sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

                        Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned 
                        to human behavior, and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that 
                        would be inadequate for other canids. Dogs vary widely in shape, size, 
                        and colors. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, 
                        pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, 
                        more recently, aiding disabled people, and therapeutic roles. This influence 
                        on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."
