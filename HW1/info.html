            <h6>How big will they get?</h6>
            Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known
            adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only 6.3 centimetres
            (2 1⁄2 inches) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3 3⁄4 in) in length along
            the head-and-body, and weighed only 113 grams (4 ounces). The most massive
            known dog was a Saint Bernard, which weighed 167.6 kg (369 1⁄2 lb) and was
            250 cm (8 ft 2 in) from the snout to the tail.[32] The tallest dog is a
            Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (3 ft 6 in) at the shoulder

            <h6>What do they look like?</h6>
            The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties:
            "double" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves)
            originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard
            hair and a soft down hair, or "single," with the topcoat only.
            Breeds may have an occasional "blaze," stripe, or "star" of white
            fur on their chest or underside.The coat can be maintained or affected by
            multiple nutrients present in the diet.Premature graying can occur in dogs
            from as early as one year of age; this is shown to be associated with impulsive
            behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or
            animals.

            <h6>How long will they live?</h6>
            In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live, on average, 1.2 years longer
            than pure breeds. Increasing body-weight was negatively correlated with
            longevity (i.e., the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan).The typical
            lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity,
            the age at which half the dogs in a population have died, and half are still
            alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years. Individual dogs may live
            well beyond the median of their breed.The breed with the shortest lifespan
            (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with reasonable
            sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about
            5.2 years. Still, several breeds, including miniature bull terriers,
            bloodhounds, and Irish wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median
            longevities of 6 to 7 years.The longest-lived breeds, including toy poodles,
            Japanese spitz, Border terriers, and Tibetan spaniels, have median longevities
            of 14 to 15 years. The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as
            an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of
            purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged. The longest-lived dog was
            "Bluey," an Australian Cattle Dog who died in 1939 at 29.5 years of age.

            <h6>What are the differences between wolves and dogs?</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The tympanic bullae are large, convex, and almost spherical 
                    in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed, 
                    and slightly crumpled
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls 
                    and 30% smaller brains.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive "stop" between the 
                    forehead and nose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs unless there has been 
                    admixture with dogs that had them.
